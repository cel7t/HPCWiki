## Software - yaksa


#### Description
Yaksa is a high-performance datatype engine for expressing, managing and manipulating data present in noncontiguous memory regions. It provides portable abstractions for structured noncontiguous data layouts that are much more comprehensive compared with traditional I/O vectors. Yaksa imitates parts of the MPI Datatype system, but adds additional functionality that would allow it to be used independent of MPI. It provides routines for packing/unpacking, creating I/O vectors (array of contiguous segments) and flattening/unflattening datatypes into process- portable formats. Yaksa's backend includes support for CPUs as well as different GPUs.
