## Package Management

### What are ModuleFiles?

Modulefiles are files that are used to setup the local environment to configure various software packages.

### What is Spack?

The HPC facility provides users access to Spack, a package management tool designed to support multiple versions and configurations of a software on a wide variety of platforms and environments.

### What is the difference between Modulefiles and Spack?

Modulefiles are either generated by the package or by the administrator. On the other hand, Spack is a superset of modulefiles and generates the appropriate modulefiles for the installed package. An advantage of Spack is that it offers dependency management for packages.


### Between Modulefiles and Spack, which is more user friendly? 

Spack is more user friendly and also offers bash auto-completion for its commands. It simplifies package management and version control for the system administrator.
